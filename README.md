This repository contains a Python-based tool for financial market analysis. It includes functionalities for data loading, preprocessing, statistical modeling, machine learning modeling, visualization, and more.

## Features

- **Data Handling**:
  - Load data from CSV files, databases, and APIs.
  - Clean and preprocess data (handling missing values, normalization).

- **Analysis**:
  - Calculate basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, min/max).
  - Perform feature engineering (creating lag features, etc.).
  - Generate correlation matrices.

- **Modeling**:
  - Implement statistical models (ARIMA, GARCH).
  - Develop machine learning models (linear regression, clustering).
  - Evaluate model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix).

- **Visualization**:
  - Plot time series data (line plots, candlestick charts).
  - Create interactive plots (using Plotly).
  - Visualize correlations (heatmaps).
